# Modified Unreal Engine Animation Sample Project

This repository contains a modified version of the official Unreal Engine Animation Sample Project. The original project provides a comprehensive set of over 500 AAA-quality animations and a fully functional character with animation Blueprints, designed to showcase Unreal Engine's Motion Matching toolset.

## Original Project Overview

The Game Animation Sample Project from Epic Games is a free resource for developers. [1] It's designed to help users create high-quality character locomotion and other gameplay animation systems. [1]

**Key features of the original project include:**

*   **Over 500 AAA-quality animations:** A vast database to supercharge development. [1]
*   **Fully functional character and animation Blueprint:** Ready to use and learn from. [1]
*   **Motion Matching Toolset:** Demonstrates the capabilities of Unreal Engine's latest animation technology. [1]
*   **Suitable for AAA and Indie Developers:** Offers a sandbox for AAA pre-production and plug-and-play locomotion for indie projects. [1]
*   **Compatibility:** Animations are compatible with all UE Mannequins and can be retargeted. [1]
*   **Multiple Motion Matching Databases:** Showcases best practices for organizing animation data. [1]
*   **Advanced Animation Techniques:** Utilizes Choosers, Proxy Tables, and Pose Warping to manage animation selection and coverage. [1]
*   **Authoring and Debugging Tools:** Includes tools like the Rewind Debugger. [1]

### What is Motion Matching?

Motion Matching is a technique that continuously selects the best animation frame to play from a large database based on the character's current pose and predicted future movement. [1] This allows for highly realistic and seamless transitions, even for complex actions like jumping, falling, and parkour. [1] The system can scale with the size of your animation dataset and uses Pose Warping to fill in any gaps. [1]

## Purpose of this Fork/Modification

This modified version of the Animation Sample Project serves as a streamlined template, primarily for **level design prototyping**. The core third-person character animations are invaluable for quickly implementing player movement and controls, allowing for immediate focus on level layout and design without needing to build these systems from scratch.

The project has been adjusted to be more lightweight and modular, facilitating easy migration of the animation system into new Unreal Engine projects where rapid prototyping of game spaces is the main goal. While the original high-definition character models are excellent, they are not essential for the initial level design phase and have been removed to reduce project size. Custom characters will be integrated later during the polishing phase of specific game projects.

## Modifications Made

Here's a summary of the key changes implemented in this version:

*   **Reduced Project Size by Removing High-Definition Character Models:**
    *   Description: Several of the original high-definition character models and their associated assets have been removed. This significantly reduces the overall project size, making it quicker to clone, open, and manage, which is beneficial during the rapid iteration phase of level design. The focus is on the animation system's functionality rather than high-fidelity character visuals at this stage.

*   **Enhanced Modularity for Easy Migration:**
    *   Description: The project structure and dependencies have been refactored to make the core animation system more modular. This simplifies the process of migrating the entire animation setup (Blueprints, animation assets, Motion Matching databases) into new or existing Unreal Engine projects with minimal friction. The goal is to enable a "plug-and-play" experience for the third-person controller and animations.

*   **Preparation for Future Plugin Integration:**
    *   Description: The project is structured to readily accommodate additional plugins that may be vital for level design prototyping. *(This section can be updated once you integrate new plugins.)*

## How to Use This Modified Project

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Unreal Engine version [**Specify the UE version you used, e.g., 5.4**]
    *   [Any other specific plugins or software needed, if any at this stage]
2.  **Setup:**
    *   Clone this repository: `git clone [Your Repository URL]`
    *   Open the `.uproject` file with the specified Unreal Engine version.
3.  **Key Areas to Explore:**
    *   Review the core Animation Blueprints and Motion Matching databases to understand the locomotion setup.
    *   The project is structured for easy migration of the `Content/[YourAnimationSystemFolder]` to your target project.
